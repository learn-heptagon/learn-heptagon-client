This directory holds two shell scripts that can be used in conjunction with git
to reject commits containing ill-formed .ml / .mli files. Are considered
ill-formed files that contain:

* Trailing whitespace.
* Lines spanning more than 80 columns.
* Tab characters.

The "pre-commit" and "update" scripts respectively handle local commits ("git
commit") and remote calls to "git push". To enable a script, just copy it to
$GIT_DIR/hooks/.

For more information, refer to the githooks manual page.
