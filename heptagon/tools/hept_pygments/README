This directory holds an Heptagon lexer for Pygments, a Python-based syntax
highlighting system. It can be used for converting Heptagon source code to
colorful LaTeX or HTML.

To install, just run "python setup.py develop --install-dir=$DIR" where $DIR is
a directory included in your $PYTHONPATH.

For more information, refer to http://pygments.org.
