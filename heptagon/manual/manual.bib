  abstract     = {Green computing is nowadays a major challenge for
                  most IT organizations.  Administrators have to
                  manage the trade-off between system performances and
                  energy saving goals. Autonomic computing is a
                  promising approach to control the QoS and the energy
                  consumed by a system.  This paper precisely
                  investigates the use of synchronous programming and
                  discrete controller synthesis to automate the
                  generation of a controller that enforces the
                  required coordination between QoS and energy
                  managers.  We illustrate our approach by describing
                  the coordination between a simple admission
                  controller and an energy controller.},

                  distribution of synchronous reactive programs to the
                  specific problem of discrete controller synthesis of
                  complex reactive systems. Discrete controller
                  synthesis is a formal method used to ensure
                  properties on a flexible system which does not a
                  priori verify them. However, this method is
                  efficient only on boolean programs. More complex
                  embedded systems, comprising complex data types and
                  structures, cannot be addressed without abstraction
                  means. We show how such abstractions can be obtained
                  automatically using a type-directed projection
                  operation. This operation allows then the safe
                  recombination of the result of the synthesis with
                  the original abstracted system, preserving the
                  ensured properties.},

  abstract     = {We describe the extension of a reactive programming
                  language with a behavioral contract construct.  It
                  is dedicated to the programming of reactive control
                  of applications in embedded systems, and involves
                  principles of the supervisory control of discrete
                  event systems.  Our contribution is in a language
                  approach where modular discrete controller synthesis
                  (DCS) is integrated, and it is concretized in the
                  encapsulation of DCS into a compilation process.
                  From transition system specifications of possible
                  behaviors, DCS automatically produces controllers
                  that make the controlled system satisfy the property
                  given as objective.  Our language features and
                  compiling technique provide
                  correctness-by-construction in that sense, and
                  enhance reliability and verifiability.  Our
                  application domain is adaptive and reconfigurable
                  systems: closed-loop adaptation mechanisms enable
                  flexible execution of functionalities w.r.t.
                  changing resource and environment conditions.  Our
                  language can serve programming such adaption
                  controllers.  This paper particularly describes the
                  compilation of the language.  We present a method
                  for the modular application of discrete controller
                  synthesis on synchronous programs, and its
                  integration in the BZR language.  We consider
                  structured programs, as a composition of nodes, and
                  first apply DCS on particular nodes of the program,
                  in order to reduce the complexity of the controller
                  computation; then, we allow the abstraction of parts
                  of the program for this computation; and finally, we
                  show how to recompose the different controllers
                  computed from different abstractions for their
                  correct co-execution with the initial program.  Our
                  work is illustrated with examples, and we present
                  quantitative results about its implementation.},
