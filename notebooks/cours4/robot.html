<h2>4.6 Voice-controlled Robot</h2>

Write the node<code>node robot_control(move_cmd, stop_cmd, obst: bool; dir, dist: int) returns (rotate, go: bool)</code>

<p>
The robot moves using two actuators:
<ul>
  <li>rotate which turns the robot clock-wise</li>
  <li>go which moves the robot forward</li>
</ul>
It has the following inputs:
<ul>
  <li>move_cmd means the robot heard the command "Move"</li>
  <li>stop_cmd means the robot heard the command "Stop"</li>
  <li>obst is true if there is an obstable between the robot and the speaker</li>
  <li>dir is the angle (in degrees, between 0 and 359) between the heading of the robot and the speaker (0 means straight ahead, 90 means to the right, etc)</li>
  <li>dist is the distance (in cm) between the robot and the speaker</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  Then, write a contract for the following requirements:
  <ol>
    <li>The robot never advances and rotates at the same time.</li>
    <li>If an obstacle is detected, the robot does not move.</li>
    <li>The robot does not move if it is or comes within half a meter of the
speaker.</li>
    <li>If a speaker gives a “Stop” command, the robot stops and does not move
until the “Move” command is given again.</li>
    <li>If the robot receives only a “Move” command by a speaker more than 1/2
meter away and there is no obstacle in the way, then the robot will start
moving.</li>
    <li>In the absence of obstacles, a moving robot will keep moving until it is
within 1/2 meter of the speaker or it receives a “Stop” command.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
