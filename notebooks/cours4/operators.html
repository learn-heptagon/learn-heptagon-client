<h2>4.2 Basic Operators</h2>

<p>
  Before we start specifying nodes, we will write a few logical operators that we may reuse later (you will have to copy and paste these definitions in other editors). Implement the following nodes:

  <ul>
    <li><code>first_int</code> and <code>first_bool</code> which constantly return the initial value of their input stream</li>
    <li><code>always</code> which returns true if its input has always been true (seen in course 1)</li>
    <li><code>exist</code> which returns true if its input has ever been true</li>
  </ul>
</p>
