<h2>4.3 Switch (example from the course)</h2>

We model a switch with two buttons, Set and Reset, where:

<ul>
  <li>Pressing Set turns the switch on</li>
  <li>Pressing Reset turns the switch off</li>
  <li>If Set and Reset are both unpressed, the switch is initialized by a third signal, S0, and keeps its previous position</li>
</ul>
